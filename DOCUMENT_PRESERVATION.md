# Document Preservation System

## Overview

This system automatically preserves uploaded documents and form data when errors occur during form submission. It prevents users from losing their work and having to re-upload documents when validation errors or network issues happen.

## Key Features

✅ **Automatic Document Backup**: All uploaded files are automatically saved to localStorage  
✅ **Form Data Preservation**: Form field values are backed up on errors  
✅ **Smart Restoration**: Data is automatically restored when users return to the form  
✅ **Error-Resilient**: Handles network errors, validation errors, and server issues  
✅ **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear notifications about document preservation status  
✅ **Cleanup Management**: Automatic cleanup of old backups to prevent storage bloat  

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Backup
- Documents are saved to localStorage immediately after upload
- Form data is backed up when errors occur
- Backups include timestamps for cleanup management

### 2. Error Handling
When errors occur during form submission:
- All uploaded documents remain in localStorage
- Form data is automatically backed up
- User sees friendly error message confirming preservation
- No need to re-upload documents

### 3. Smart Restoration
- When user returns to form, system checks for backups
- Documents and form data are automatically restored
- User is notified about restored data
- Can continue from where they left off

## Implementation

### For New Forms

```tsx
import { useDocumentPersistence } from '@/hooks/useDocumentPersistence';
import { DocumentPreservationIndicator } from '@/components/ui/DocumentPreservationIndicator';

function MyForm() {
  const [uploadedFiles, setUploadedFiles] = useState({});
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({});

  const { backup, restore, clear, hasBackup } = useDocumentPersistence({
    key: 'myFormDocuments',
    onRestore: (backup) => {
      setUploadedFiles(backup.files);
      setFormData(backup.formData);
    }
  });

  // Restore on mount
  useEffect(() => {
    if (hasBackup) restore();
  }, [hasBackup, restore]);

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    try {
      // Submit form...
      clear(); // Clear backup on success
    } catch (error) {
      backup(uploadedFiles, formData); // Backup on error
      // Show error message
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* Form fields */}
      
      <DocumentPreservationIndicator
        documentCount={Object.values(uploadedFiles).flat().length}
        hasBackup={hasBackup}
      />
      
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### For Existing Forms

You can wrap existing submission handlers:

```tsx
import { wrapWithDocumentPreservation } from '@/examples/documentPreservationExample';

const enhancedSubmitHandler = wrapWithDocumentPreservation(
  originalSubmitFunction,
  uploadedDocuments,
  formData,
  'myFormBackup'
);
```

## Components

### DocumentPreservationIndicator
Shows users the status of their document preservation:
- Green indicator when documents are uploaded and safe
- Blue notice explaining the protection system
- Restoration notice when recovering from backup

### DocumentCounter
Simple inline counter for uploaded documents

### DocumentUploadStatus
Badge showing upload status (uploading, saved, error)

### DocumentAwareErrorMessage
Enhanced error messages that emphasize document preservation

## Current Implementation

The financing application form (`FinancingApplicationForm.tsx`) already includes:

✅ **Enhanced Error Messages**: Clear notifications that documents are preserved  
✅ **Form Data Backup**: Automatic backup of form state on errors  
✅ **Visual Indicators**: Shows document preservation status  
✅ **Smart Restoration**: Restores previous session data  
✅ **Upload Error Handling**: Individual file upload errors don't lose other files  

## Error Scenarios Handled

1. **Network Errors**: Connection lost during submission
2. **Validation Errors**: Server-side field validation failures  
3. **File Upload Errors**: Individual file upload failures
4. **Session Timeouts**: Authentication issues during submission
5. **Browser Crashes**: Page reload or browser restart
6. **Navigation Away**: Accidental page navigation

## User Experience

### Before Enhancement
❌ User uploads 5 documents (takes 10 minutes)  
❌ Form has validation error  
❌ All documents lost, user must re-upload  
❌ Frustrating experience, potential abandonment  

### After Enhancement
✅ User uploads 5 documents  
✅ Form has validation error  
✅ Error message: "Please fix highlighted fields. All your uploaded documents are safely preserved."  
✅ User fixes error and resubmits  
✅ Documents are still there, smooth experience  

## Storage Management

- Backups are stored in localStorage with timestamps
- Old backups are automatically cleaned up (7 days default)
- Storage keys are namespaced to prevent conflicts
- Failed JSON parsing automatically removes corrupted data

## Browser Compatibility

- Works in all modern browsers that support localStorage
- Graceful degradation if localStorage is not available
- No external dependencies required

## Security Considerations

- Documents are stored client-side only during error recovery
- Backups are cleared after successful submission
- No sensitive data is permanently stored
- User has full control over their data

## Performance

- Lightweight implementation with minimal overhead
- Only backs up on errors, not on every change
- Automatic cleanup prevents storage bloat
- Efficient JSON serialization/deserialization

This system significantly improves user experience by ensuring that users never lose their uploaded documents when form errors occur.
